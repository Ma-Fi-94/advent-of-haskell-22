# advent-of-haskell-22-reprise

Doing 2022's AoC in Haskell, again! Because 2024 is over, and I need my fix!

Also trying to achieve sub-second runtime for every single day, because that nudges me to think more deeply about everything. Performance is measured after compiling with -O3 and executing five times on my system (Apple MacBook with M2 Max processor, 32 GB RAM.)
